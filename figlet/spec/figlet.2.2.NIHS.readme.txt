Original README:

About FIGlet (Frank, Ian & Glenn's Letters) release 2.2, 2 Oct 1996
----------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGlet is a program that creates large characters out of ordinary
screen characters
 _ _ _          _   _     _       
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___   
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|  
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \_ 
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___(_)
                                  
(This is meant to be viewed in a monospaced font.)  FIGlet can create
characters in many different styles and can kern and "smush" these
characters together in various ways.  FIGlet output is generally
reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people like to put at the
end of e-mail and UseNet messages.

If you like FIGlet (hey, even if you *hate* FIGlet), please send an
e-mail message to <figlet@uiuc.edu>.

Installing FIGlet --- Unix version
----------------------------------

First decide in which directories FIGlet and the FIGlet font files
(the ".flf" files) will be stored (we recommend "/usr/games" and
"/usr/games/lib/figlet.dir", respectively) and which will be the
default font (we recommend "standard.flf").

Edit "Makefile", and set the variables DEFAULTFONTDIR and
DEFAULTFONTFILE to the appropriate values.  Set DEFAULTFONTDIR to be
the full pathname of the directory in which you will keep the FIGlet
font files.  Set DEFAULTFONTFILE to be the filename of the default
font.

At this point, you have two choices:

(1) Just compile FIGlet.  To go this, go into the directory containing
the FIGlet source, and type "make figlet".  Then copy the various files
to the proper locations.  The executable (figlet), along with figlist
and showfigfonts, goes wherever you keep your executables.  The fonts
(<xxx>.flf) and control files (<xxx>.flc) go in the default font
directory.  The man page (figlet.6) goes in section 6 (usually
/usr/man/man6).  If you cannot, or do not want to, install the man page,
you can probably still read it using

        nroff -man figlet.6 | more

(2) Do a complete installation.  To do the this, set the variables
DESTDIR and MANDIR in Makefile to the appropriate values.  DESTDIR
should be the full pathname of the directory in which the executable
files should be put (we recommend "/usr/games");  MANDIR should be the
full pathname of the directory in which the figlet man page should be
put, generally "/usr/man/man6".  Once DEFAULTFONTDIR, DEFAULTFONTFILE,
DESTDIR and MANDIR have been set, in the directory containing the FIGlet
source, type "make install".

If space is a problem, the only files you absolutely must have to run
figlet are "figlet" (the executable) and at least one font (preferably
the one you chose to be the default font).

Installing FIGlet -- DOS version
--------------------------------

Unpack the ZIPfile using PKUNZIP, Info-Zip UNZIP, WinUnzip, or any other
ZIP-compatible program.  Be sure to use the -d option with PKUNZIP
in order to preserve the directory structure.  We recommend that you
unpack the archive into C:\FIGLET, but any directory will do.

If you unpack the archive on top of an older version of FIGlet, be
sure to delete the file FIGLET.COM.  The executable program in this
release is named FIGLET.EXE.  You can keep your old fonts by putting
them in a FONTS subdirectory before unpacking.  (There are upgraded
versions of the standard fonts in the archive.)

Using FIGlet
------------

(Note: FIGlet needs a good thorough tutorial.  Currently I don't have
the time to write one, but if anyone wants to do so, go right ahead.
I'd be glad to help out a little.  Write us at <figlet@uiuc.edu> if
you're interested.  -GGC-)

At the shell prompt, type "figlet".  Then type, say, "Hello, world!"
and press return.  "Hello, world!" in nice, big, designer characters
should appear on your screen.  If you chose standard.flf to be the
default font, you should see
 _   _      _ _                             _     _ _ 
| | | | ___| | | ___    __      _____  _ __| | __| | |
| |_| |/ _ \ | |/ _ \   \ \ /\ / / _ \| '__| |/ _` | |
|  _  |  __/ | | (_) |   \ V  V / (_) | |  | | (_| |_|
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___( )   \_/\_/ \___/|_|  |_|\__,_(_)
                    |/                                
Then type something else, or type an EOF (typically control-D) to quit
FIGlet.

Now you can send the output of figlet to a file (e.g., "figlet > file")
and e-mail it to your friends (who will probably say, "Wow!  It must
have taken you hours to put that together!")

To use other fonts, use the "-f" command line option.  For example, if
you had said "figlet -f smslant" above, you would have seen
   __ __    ____                         __   ____
  / // /__ / / /__      _    _____  ____/ /__/ / /
 / _  / -_) / / _ \_   | |/|/ / _ \/ __/ / _  /_/ 
/_//_/\__/_/_/\___( )  |__,__/\___/_/ /_/\_,_(_)  
                  |/                              

Here are some other useful command line options:

-c   center -- centers the output of FIGlet.
-k  tells FIGlet to kern characters without smushing them together.
-t   terminal -- FIGlet asks your terminal how wide it is, and uses
     this to determine when to break lines.  Normally, FIGlet assumes
     80 columns so that people with wide terminals won't annoy the
     people they e-mail FIGlet output to.
-p   paragraph mode -- eliminates some spurious line breaks when piping
     a multi-line file through FIGlet.
-v   version -- prints information about your copy of FIGlet.

For in-depth explanations of these and other options, see the man page.
DOS users, see figlet.man.


Other Fonts & Mailing List
--------------------------

A good number of FIGlet fonts have been developed, most of which are
not included in the standard FIGlet package.  Many of these can be
obtained by anonymous FTP from ftp.nicoh.com in the directory
"pub/figlet/fonts".  Some non-Roman fonts are available at the FTP
site.  As of this writing, we have Hebrew, Cyrillic (Russian) and
Greek.

We run an e-mail list dedicated to FIGlet software and font
announcements, as well as general discussion about FIGlet.  If you
would like to be on this list, send e-mail to listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu
with the message body
        subscribe figlet-l YOUR NAME
where YOUR NAME should be replaced with your name.  For those who don't
want to be bothered with the discussions, the list can be configured so
that you only see software update notices, or only software and font
announcements.

Other Stuff
-----------

FIGlet is available for operating systems other than Unix.  E-mail us
for more information.

Although you don't have to design your own fonts to use FIGlet, we'd
certainly like it if lots of people did make up new FIGlet fonts.  If
you feel like giving it a try, see the "FONT FILE FORMAT" section of
the man page.  If you do design a font, please let us know!

See "Other Things to Try" in the EXAMPLES section of the man page
for... well... other things to try.


Authors
-------

FIGlet was written mostly by Glenn Chappell <c486scm@semovm.semo.edu>.  The
author not being an e-mail fanatic, most correspondence (bug reports, rave
reviews, etc.) should be directed to his secretary (who is definitely
an e-mail fanatic), Ian Chai <chai@uiuc.edu>.

Changes in FIGlet 2.2
---------------------

FIGlet 2.2 is a moderate revision of FIGlet 2.1.2.  The new features are:

o	font files and control files can be compressed using ``zip'', and
	will be automatically decompressed

o	new commands in controlfiles provide support for
	single-int (default), double-byte, HZ, Shift-JIS, and Unicode
	UTF-8 encodings of the input

o	ISO 2022 escape sequences are decoded and interpreted

o	control files can now have the format of Unicode Consortium
	mapping tables (two columns of numbers representing
	input character and output character, no ranges, # comments)

o	new options -s (smush, same as -m-2), -k (kern, same as -m0),
	-S (forced smushing), and -W (full width, same as -m-1) make
	-m option unnecessary except for font designers.  The -S option
	works even if the font's smushmode is 0 or -1, in which case
	the smushmode is read from a new parameter in the
	font's first line, or does universal overlapping if no such parameter
	exists

o	universal smushing (-o option to force it, but -S will use it
	if no smush rules are available) makes FIGcharacters overlap by
	one place independent of how they are constructed
	more fonts smushable.

o	file "figmagic" can be appended to your system magic number
	file to make the "file" command recognize FIGlet files

o	file "figfont.txt" is an implementation-independent specification
	for FIGlet fonts and control files

o	integrated support for extended characters (extended Latin in
	"standard", Greek in "big", katakana in "banner", Hebrew in new
	"ivrit" fonts) with appropriate controlfiles

o	smushing rule 16 has changed slightly: "/\" now smushes
	into "|" and "\/" smushes into "Y"; "><" still smushes
	into "X" and "<>" is still not smushed at all.

o	-A option introduced in FIGlet 2.1.2 is now optional;
	if any words appear on the command line after the options,
	they are formatted, and the standard input is not read.

These changes were made by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>.

Changes in FIGlet 2.1.2
------------------------

FIGlet 2.1.2 is a minor revision of FIGlet 2.1.1.  The files
README, FTP-NOTE, figlet.c and figlet.6 have been changed.  All other
files are identical with the 2.1.1 release.

o	The only new option is -A, which causes FIGlet to read input
	from the command line.

These changes were made by Gilbert Healton <ghealton@nmia.com> as Glenn
Chappell is now busy as a new professor of Mathematics.

Changes in FIGlet 2.1
----------------------

A number of minor bugs and major incompatibility problems have been
fixed.  FIGlet 2.1 should compile correctly on many operating systems for
which FIGlet 2.0 did not.

o	The "-F" command line option, which used to list all the available
	fonts, has been removed, since it made FIGlet incompatible with some
	operating systems.  It has been replaced by the "figlist" script.  The
	"showfigfonts" script has been updated so that it no longer requires
	the "-F" option to be available.

o	The FIGlet font file format has been extended to allow an arbitrarily
	large number of characters.  The ISO Latin-1 character set, which
	includes many accented letters and special symbols, has been added to
	most standard fonts.

o	FIGlet can now print right-to-left.  This can be specified on the
	command line ("-R") or in the font file.  Thus, for example, Hebrew and
	Arabic fonts can be handled more easily.

o	FIGlet can now right justify its output.  This is the default when
	right-to-left printing is selected.  It can also be specified on the
	command line ("-r").

o	FIGlet now supports "control files".  These can be used to change which
	character FIGlet will print when it sees a certain input character --
	sort of an expanded version of the "-D" option.  For example, a control
	file could convert lower-case letters to upper-case or map certain
	ASCII characters to accented letters.  Control file names end with the
	suffix ".flc".  Select a control file by using "-C controlfile" on the
	command line.  Several controlfiles can be used at once by giving
	muliple "-C" options.

o	There is now a way for programs that use FIGlet to get various
	information from FIGlet, for example, what version of FIGlet is being
	used or the name of the default font directory.  This information is
	gotten through the "-I" option.  See the man page for details.
